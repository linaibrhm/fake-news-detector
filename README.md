## (!IMPORTANT!) How To Run
GitHub does not allow uploading file size that is >100MB, so I prompted to uploading my project onto Google Drive. I recommend reading the README.md file on Google Drive for more detailed information and explanation regarding this project.

1. Go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W28UX_1PMxSH3209OqEAj6aJdUvwlRIW?usp=sharing
2. Download ZIP folder
3. Open 'app.py' file
4. Open terminal and run "python app.py" (make sure file directory is correct)
5. Open web browser and paste "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
